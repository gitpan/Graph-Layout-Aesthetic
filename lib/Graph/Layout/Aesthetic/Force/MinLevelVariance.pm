=head1 NAME

Graph::Layout::Aesthetic::Force::MinLevelVariance - nodes repel each other

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Graph::Layout::Aesthetic;
  $aglo = Graph::Layout::Aesthetic->new($topology);
  $aglo->add_force("MinLevelVariance", 1);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an aesthetic force for use by the 
L<Graph::Layout::Aesthetic package|Graph::Layout::Aesthetic>. It's normally
implicitly loaded by using L<add_force|Graph::Layout::Aesthetic/add_force>.

The aesthetic force is that it tries to place nodes on the same level on the 
same distance from the left (same x-coordinate). The level of a node is 
roughly its distance from a leaf. For each level it then calculates the average
x-coordinate, and for each node it then tries to move it along the x-axis with
a force that grows as the third power of its distance from its level average.

The old aglo documentation describes the force of this aesthetic as 
being quadratic in the distance, but that's actually not what the code does.

=head1 METHODS

This class inherits from 
L<Graph::Layout::Aesthetic::Force|Graph::Layout::Aesthetic::Force> and adds
no methods of its own.

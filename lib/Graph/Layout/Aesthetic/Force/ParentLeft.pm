Graph::Layout::Aesthetic::Force::ParentLeft - nodes repel each other

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Graph::Layout::Aesthetic;
  $aglo = Graph::Layout::Aesthetic->new($topology);
  $aglo->add_force("ParentLeft", 1);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an aesthetic force for use by the
L<Graph::Layout::Aesthetic package|Graph::Layout::Aesthetic>. It's normally
implicitly loaded by using L<add_force|Graph::Layout::Aesthetic/add_force>.

The aesthetic force is that it tries to place parent nodes at least 5 to the 
left of child nodes. If nodes are placed so that this condition is not 
fulfilled, the nodes try to move left or right so it will be with a force 
that's quadratic in how much their distance on the x-axis is wrong.

=head1 METHODS

This class inherits from
L<Graph::Layout::Aesthetic::Force|Graph::Layout::Aesthetic::Force> and adds
no methods of its own.

=head1 EXPORT

None.

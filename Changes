Revision history for Perl extension Graph::Layout::Aesthetic.

TODO:
	- tests for gloss.pl
        - Make the forces into subpackages
	- For gloss_graph maybe allow to get the number of dimensions
	  from a graph attribute, or from the pos/hold attribute size
	  if array references or the already existing coordinates if hold is
	  a string. Not sure if this is a good idea.
        - Add magic tests (works at all, no extra uneeded accesses)

0.08  2004-11-07
        - There were variable declarations inside code.
        - Predeclare the boot_ calls.
	- remove aglo_point_iso_frame before anyone thinks that actually works.
	- Removed some unused variables
	- Rename the variable "rand" to something else. Some compilers dislike
	  the conflict with rand().
	- Call perl rand through the opcode table if the random generator is 
          uninitialized.
	- Remove inline, unportable
	- tests should not depend on fileseparator
	- Don't use the OO interface to File::Temp, it's not yet in older 
	  perls.
	- File::Temp tempfiles are seemingly opened in binmode. Do the tail
	  in textmode in t/05_GnuPlot.t

0.07  2004-11-06
	- Make user_data and _private data into lvalue subs.
	- Added some get magic.
	- Simplified the gen_include makerule so hopefully nmake can now
          handle it.

0.06  2004-10-01
	- Forgot to document Graph::Layout::Aesthetic::Force::MinEdgeLength.
        - Forgot to update the NAME entry of the different forces.
	- Graph::Layout::Aesthetic::Force::Perl gradient was documented wrong.
	- Other minor docs updates.
	- Have "layout" as an alias for gloss_graph
          (not documented/tested yet)
	- Allow to drop the first argument (class) to gloss_graph/layout so
	  you can also use it as a function (not documented/tested yet).

0.05  2004-10-01
	- The gnuplot tests still failed for the solaris cpan tester, but at
          least it gets close now.

0.04  2004-09-30
        - Warn in case of a clear_forces during a gradient call.
	- The gnuplot tests still seem to fail for the solaris cpan tester,
          but I can't reproduce the problem on my solaris box.
          Stop using the IPC::Open3 hacks and try hacks involving ``

0.03  2004-09-29
	- gnuplot test failed if user doesn't have gnuplot.
        - Fix potential coredump when destroying forces during a gradient call
          (and added a test for it)
        - Document that the aglo and topology object are not threadsafe.

0.02  2004-09-29
	- Changed the default attributes to have a layout_ prefix to be
	  more compatible with Graph::Layouter
	- set frame coordinates as attributes on a graph if requested
	- Mention Graph::Layouter and Graph::Renderer in the docs
	- Added a $VERSION to a few forgotten modules

0.01  2004-09-29
        - Lots of programming and testing.
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-A -n Graph::Layout::Aesthetic

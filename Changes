Revision history for Perl extension Graph::Layout::Aesthetic.

TODO:
	- tests for gloss.pl
        - Make the forces into subpackages
	- For gloss_graph maybe allow to get the number of dimensions
	  from a graph attribute, or from the pos/hold attribute size
	  if array references or the already existing coordinates if hold is
	  a string. Not sure if this is a good idea.

Revision history for Perl extension Graph::Layout::Aesthetic.

TODO:
	- tests for gloss.pl
        - Make the forces into subpackages
	- For gloss_graph maybe allow to get the number of dimensions
	  from a graph attribute, or from the pos/hold attribute size
	  if array references or the already existing coordinates if hold is
	  a string. Not sure if this is a good idea.

0.06 2004-10-01
	- Forgot to document Graph::Layout::Aesthetic::Force::MinEdgeLength.
        - Forgot to update the NAME entry of the different forces
	- Graph::Layout::Aesthetic::Force::Perl gradient was documented wrong.
	- Other minor docs updates.
	- Have "layout" as an alias for gloss_graph (not documented yet)
	- Allow to drop the first argument (class) to gloss_graph so you can
          also use it as a function (not documented yet).

        - Warn in case of a clear_forces during a gradient call.
	- The gnuplot tests still seem to fail for the solaris cpan tester,
          but I can't reproduce the problem on my solaris box.
          Stop using the IPC::Open3 hacks and try hacks involving ``

0.03  2004-09-29
	- gnuplot test failed if user doesn't have gnuplot.
        - Fix potential coredump when destroying forces during a gradient call

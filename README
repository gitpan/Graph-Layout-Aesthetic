Graph-Layout-Aesthetic version 0.01
==============================

Notice that this package contains C code, so you either need to get a 
precompiled package, or you'll need a working development setup.

DESCRIPTION

The Graph::Layout::Aesthetic package allows the laying out of a graph.
The idea is that a state is repeatedly modified until an acceptable layout is
reached. This is done by considering the current state from the point of view
of a number of aesthetic criteria, each of which will provide a a step along
which it would like to change the current state. A weighted average is then
taken of all these steps, leading to a proposed step. The size of this step
is then limited using a decrasing parameter (the temperature) and applied.
Small random disturbances may also be applied to avoid getting stuck
in a subspace.

The package also comes with a simple commandline tool L<gloss.pl|gloss.pl(1)>
(based on this package) that allows you to lay out graphs.
